				months ago. Initially, the symptoms were manageable but have progressively intensified,
				leading to significant disruptions in daily functioning. The patient notes difficulty
				sleeping, decreased appetite, and persistent fatigue. Work performance has suffered, with
				increased absenteeism and difficulty concentrating. Coping attempts include increased
				exercise and mindfulness practices, but these have provided limited relief. Social

				The patient reports missing several days of work in the past month due to overwhelming

				with family providing critical emotional support.

		<h2 class="section-title">ASSESSMENT</h2>
		<section class="section paragraph" id="clinical-formulation">
			<h3 class="subsection-title">CLINICAL FORMULATION:</h3>
			<p>
				The patient presents with a complex interplay of depressive and anxiety symptoms,
				significantly impacting daily functioning. A PHQ-9 score of 17 indicates moderate to severe
				depression, characterized by persistent sadness, anhedonia, and fatigue. The GAD-7 score of
				15 corroborates the presence of generalized anxiety, resulting in concentration difficulties
				and social withdrawal. Family psychiatric history suggests a genetic predisposition,
				complicating the patient's emotional resilience. Protective factors include a supportive
				family network and personal strengths in problem-solving and resilience. The patient's
				insight and motivation to re-engage in therapy are encouraging for treatment adherence.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="section paragraph" id="risk-assessment">
			<h3 class="subsection-title">RISK ASSESSMENT:</h3>
			<p>
				The patient denies any current suicidal or homicidal ideation, with PHQ-9 item 9 indicating
				passive suicidal thoughts without intent. Protective factors include strong family support
				and clear personal goals. No history of self-harm or suicide attempts is reported. Substance
				use is minimal, reducing relapse risk. The patient is aware of crisis plan resources and
				feels confident in accessing support if needed. Immediate risk is low, but ongoing
				monitoring of mood fluctuations is recommended to prevent escalation.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="section paragraph" id="prognosis">
			<h3 class="subsection-title">PROGNOSIS:</h3>
			<p>
				The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, given the patient's willingness to pursue treatment
				and strong support system. Symptom severity and chronicity present challenges, but
				motivation for change is high, and previous treatment has shown partial efficacy. The
				patient's work-related stress and financial concerns may complicate recovery but are
				countered by problem-solving skills and resilience. The absence of significant comorbidities
				and substance use issues further supports a favorable outcome with consistent intervention.
