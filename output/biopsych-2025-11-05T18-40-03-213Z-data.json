    "chiefComplaint": "\"I can't shake this feeling of sadness and anxiety that keeps getting worse.\"",
    "subjective": {
      "hpi": "The patient reports a pervasive sense of sadness and anxiety that began approximately six months ago. Initially, the symptoms were manageable but have progressively intensified, leading to significant disruptions in daily functioning. The patient notes difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, and persistent fatigue. Work performance has suffered, with increased absenteeism and difficulty concentrating. Coping attempts include increased exercise and mindfulness practices, but these have provided limited relief. Social interactions have diminished, causing strain in personal relationships.",
      "pastPsychiatricHistory": "The patient has a history of depression diagnosed two years ago, which was treated with Sertraline for six months, resulting in partial symptom relief. The patient attended cognitive behavioral therapy for several months but discontinued due to perceived lack of progress. No hospitalizations or other psychiatric medications have been reported. Currently, the patient is not receiving psychiatric treatment but expresses willingness to re-engage in therapy.",
      "currentMedications": "Sertraline is prescribed for depression, and Lorazepam is taken as needed for anxiety.",
      "familyPsychiatricHistory": "The patient's family history includes a mother diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a sibling with a history of anxiety. The presence of mental illness in the family is acknowledged as a potential genetic predisposition. The patient reports no known history of substance use disorders within the family.",
      "medicalHistory": "The patient reports being in generally good health with no significant medical conditions. There are no known medication allergies, and the patient describes overall well-being outside of psychiatric symptoms. The absence of chronic medical issues suggests minimal medical-psychiatric interactions.",
      "socialHistory": "The patient lives alone in an apartment, which sometimes amplifies feelings of loneliness. They maintain a close relationship with family, who provide emotional support. Employed full-time, the patient finds job stress contributing to mental health struggles. Financially stable but expresses concern about future job security. Despite challenges, the patient identifies resilience and problem-solving as personal strengths.",
      "substanceUseHistory": "The patient reports occasional alcohol use, approximately 1-2 drinks per week, with no history of problematic use. Denies use of tobacco or illicit drugs. There are no reported legal or health consequences related to substance use. Insight into maintaining moderate use is expressed, with no current motivation for change needed as patterns are deemed non-problematic."
    },
    "objective": {
      "functionalAssessment": "The patient reports missing several days of work in the past month due to overwhelming anxiety and fatigue, impacting job performance. Relationships with colleagues have become strained, with less social engagement noted. Self-care routines, including regular exercise and healthy eating, have been inconsistently maintained. Despite these challenges, the patient remains committed to maintaining independence and exhibits strong problem-solving skills. The patient's ability to manage daily tasks independently is largely preserved, though motivation fluctuates with mood changes. Social interactions are limited but valued, with family providing critical emotional support."
    },
    "assessment": {
      "clinicalFormulation": "The patient presents with a complex interplay of depressive and anxiety symptoms, significantly impacting daily functioning. A PHQ-9 score of 17 indicates moderate to severe depression, characterized by persistent sadness, anhedonia, and fatigue. The GAD-7 score of 15 corroborates the presence of generalized anxiety, resulting in concentration difficulties and social withdrawal. Family psychiatric history suggests a genetic predisposition, complicating the patient's emotional resilience. Protective factors include a supportive family network and personal strengths in problem-solving and resilience. The patient's insight and motivation to re-engage in therapy are encouraging for treatment adherence.",
      "riskAssessment": "The patient denies any current suicidal or homicidal ideation, with PHQ-9 item 9 indicating passive suicidal thoughts without intent. Protective factors include strong family support and clear personal goals. No history of self-harm or suicide attempts is reported. Substance use is minimal, reducing relapse risk. The patient is aware of crisis plan resources and feels confident in accessing support if needed. Immediate risk is low, but ongoing monitoring of mood fluctuations is recommended to prevent escalation.",
      "prognosis": "The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, given the patient's willingness to pursue treatment and strong support system. Symptom severity and chronicity present challenges, but motivation for change is high, and previous treatment has shown partial efficacy. The patient's work-related stress and financial concerns may complicate recovery but are countered by problem-solving skills and resilience. The absence of significant comorbidities and substance use issues further supports a favorable outcome with consistent intervention.",
