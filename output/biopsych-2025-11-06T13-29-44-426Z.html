He reports severe depression with daily anhedonia, sleep disturbances, and fatigue, impacting his work and relationships significantly. The PHQ-9 score of 21 confirms severe depression, with passive suicidal ideation noted. His anxiety, marked by a GAD-7 score of 14, manifests as irritability and constant worry, complicating his ability to relax. These symptoms have led to eight sick days in three months, strained family ties, and poor self-care, exacerbated by daily alcohol use as a coping mechanism.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="past-psych-history"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:</h3><p>Mr. Rodriguez has a history of attempting psychiatric treatment, including a six-month trial of Zoloft, which he discontinued due to perceived ineffectiveness. He also tried Trazodone for sleep, which was stopped due to morning grogginess. Despite attending DUI classes, he has not engaged in formal substance use disorder treatment. He has no history of psychiatric hospitalizations but acknowledges the need for comprehensive treatment now.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="previous-medications"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">PREVIOUSLY TRIALED MEDICATIONS:</h3><p>Zoloft 50mg 6 months (stopped on own, felt ineffective), Trazodone 50mg 3 months (morning grogginess)</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="current-medications"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">CURRENT MEDICATIONS:</h3><p>Lisinopril for high blood pressure, Ibuprofen for chronic back pain.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="family-psych-history"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:</h3><p>His father had depression and alcoholism, which led to liver disease-related death at 58. His mother suffers from anxiety, and his brother has PTSD from military service. These familial patterns suggest a genetic predisposition to mental health and substance use issues, exacerbating Mr. Rodriguez's current struggles.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="medical-history"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">MEDICAL HISTORY:</h3><p>Mr. Rodriguez has hypertension, chronic back pain from a 2018 work injury, and diet-controlled pre-diabetes. He is allergic to Penicillin, causing hives, and Codeine, which induces nausea. His chronic pain and hypertension may interplay with his mental health issues, complicating his emotional well-being and stress management.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="social-history"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">SOCIAL HISTORY:</h3><p>Living alone post-divorce, Mr. Rodriguez works full-time as a warehouse supervisor but faces severe work-related stress, missing multiple days due to his symptoms.

His sister offers significant support, though his social network remains limited due to isolation.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="substance-use-history"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">SUBSTANCE USE HISTORY:</h3><p>Mr. Rodriguez consumes alcohol daily, with a pattern of binge drinking on weekends, as confirmed by an AUDIT score of 28. He also smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily and uses marijuana occasionally. Past cocaine use ceased following a DUI.

At work, he has called in sick eight times in three months and struggles with concentration and irritability, risking job security. Relationship-wise, his divorce and limited time with his daughters weigh heavily, leading to isolation and strained family interactions. He neglects self-care, with irregular eating, poor sleep, and a cluttered living environment. Socially, he is isolated, having lost friendships during his marriage and divorce. Despite these challenges, he remains a hard worker and is motivated by his responsibility to his daughters and support from his sister.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="standardized-scores"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT SCORES:</h3></section></section><section class="note-section note-section--top" id="assessment"><h2 class="note-section-banner">ASSESSMENT</h2><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="clinical-formulation"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">CLINICAL FORMULATION:</h3><p>Mr. Rodriguez presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by severe depression, PTSD from childhood and adult traumas, and a severe alcohol use disorder. His PHQ-9 score of 21 indicates significant depressive symptoms, exacerbated by family stress and high ACE score of 6. PTSD symptoms, including hypervigilance and flashbacks, are intertwined with his anxiety, scored at 14 on the GAD-7. His severe alcohol use, verified by an AUDIT score of 28, serves as a maladaptive coping strategy, further complicating his mental health. Protective factors include his insight, motivation to change for his daughters, and his sister's support, although immediate risks such as potential job loss and health deterioration from alcohol use are present.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="risk-assessment"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">RISK ASSESSMENT:</h3><p>Mr. Rodriguez denies current suicidal ideation but reported passive thoughts six months ago, linked to his divorce. His alcohol use poses significant relapse risks, with consequences including a DUI. He has a history of anger issues, although no homicidal ideation. Protective factors include his daughters and sister, who provide motivation and support. Regular monitoring and a crisis plan are essential, given his history and current stress level. Emergency contacts are established, and he is aware of crisis resources.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="prognosis"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">PROGNOSIS:</h3><p>Mr. Rodriguez's prognosis is cautiously optimistic, contingent on addressing his severe symptoms and comorbidities. His high motivation score of 8/10 and insight into his condition are favorable. However, financial stress, housing stability, and employment pressures may impede treatment adherence. His support system, though limited, is a protective factor. The chronicity of his conditions and past treatment non-adherence are considerations for potential challenges in achieving lasting recovery.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--table" id="diagnostic-impressions"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:</h3><table class="table" aria-label="DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:"><colgroup><col style="width:10%"><col style="width:12%"><col style="width:78%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col">ICD-10</th><th scope="col">DSM-5 Code</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-muted">F33.2</span></td><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-bold">F33.2</span></td><td><div class="note-table-stack"><span class="note-table-primary note-table-strong">Major Depressive Disorder, Severe</span><span class="note-table-support note-table-italic note-table-muted">Severe Major Depressive Disorder is evidenced by nearly daily anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, and passive suicidal ideation.
