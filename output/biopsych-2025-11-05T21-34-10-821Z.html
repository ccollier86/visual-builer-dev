There have been occasional absences from work, although the patient strives to maintain responsibilities. Relationships are strained, as anxiety contributes to social withdrawal and conflict avoidance. Self-care routines are maintained but with reduced motivation. Social engagement is limited, with the patient preferring solitude over social activities, exacerbating feelings of loneliness. Despite these challenges, the patient demonstrates strong organizational skills and a commitment to personal wellness practices, such as regular exercise, which help mitigate some functional impairments.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="standardized-scores"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT SCORES:</h3></section></section><section class="note-section note-section--top" id="assessment"><h2 class="note-section-banner">ASSESSMENT</h2><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="clinical-formulation"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">CLINICAL FORMULATION:</h3><p>The patient presents with symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder, characterized by pervasive anxiety impacting work and social functioning. The clinical picture is compounded by a family history of mood and anxiety disorders, suggesting a genetic predisposition. The patient’s PHQ-9 score indicates moderate depression, with anhedonia and sleep disturbances present. GAD-7 scores reflect severe anxiety, aligning with the patient’s reported experiences. Protective factors include a supportive social network and strong organizational skills, which provide some resilience against the functional impacts of anxiety. The interplay between anxiety and situational stressors, such as financial pressures, further exacerbates symptoms. Treatment will aim to address both the psychological symptoms and the contributing environmental stressors.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="risk-assessment"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">RISK ASSESSMENT:</h3><p>The patient denies any current or historical suicidal or homicidal ideation. There are no past self-harm behaviors or substance use issues. The presence of anxiety presents a risk for heightened distress under stress, but the patient demonstrates insight and a willingness to engage in treatment. Protective factors include a supportive network of friends and a commitment to self-care practices. The patient is aware of emergency contacts and crisis resources, providing additional safety measures. The risk is assessed as low, with recommendations for regular monitoring and therapeutic interventions to manage anxiety effectively.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="prognosis"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">PROGNOSIS:</h3><p>The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, given the patient’s motivation to engage in treatment and existing personal strengths. The severity of anxiety and financial stressors present challenges; however, the patient’s insight and organizational skills are favorable factors. Previous lack of consistent treatment engagement suggests the need for structured and supportive therapeutic interventions. The patient’s willingness to explore medication options and engage in therapy increases the likelihood of symptom improvement. Continued support from friends and a focus on financial planning may alleviate some stressors, contributing to a positive treatment outcome.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--table" id="diagnostic-impressions"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:</h3><table class="table" aria-label="DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:"><colgroup><col style="width:10%"><col style="width:12%"><col style="width:78%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col">ICD-10</th><th scope="col">DSM-5 Code</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-muted">F41.1</span></td><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-bold">F33.2</span></td><td><div class="note-table-stack"><span class="note-table-primary note-table-strong">Major Depressive Disorder, Severe</span><span class="note-table-support note-table-muted">GAD-7 score indicates severe anxiety impacting daily functioning and relationships.</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-muted">F33.1</span></td><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-bold">F43.10</span></td><td><div class="note-table-stack"><span class="note-table-primary note-table-strong">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</span><span class="note-table-support note-table-muted">PHQ-9 score reflects moderate depression with persistent anhedonia and sleep issues.</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-bold">F10.20</span></td><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-strong">Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe</span></td></tr></tbody></table></section></section><section class="note-section note-section--top" id="plan"><h2 class="note-section-banner">PLAN</h2><section class="note-section note-section--list" id="interventions-recommended"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">INTERVENTIONS RECOMMENDED:</h3><ol class="list"><li>Medical Management: Referral to primary care physician for medical conditions and psychiatric evaluation for potential pharmacological intervention for presenting symptoms.</li><li>Individual Psychotherapy: Regular individual therapy sessions to address identified issues.
