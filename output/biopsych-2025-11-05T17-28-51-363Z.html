				The patient reports experiencing overwhelming anxiety for the past six months, significantly
				impacting her daily functioning. She describes persistent worry about her job performance,
				leading to difficulty concentrating and frequent errors at work. The anxiety is exacerbated
				by social situations, where she fears judgment and criticism. Sleep disturbances have also
				been noted, with difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings. Despite these
				challenges, she has attempted to manage her symptoms through deep breathing exercises and
				occasional use of over-the-counter sleep aids, with limited success. Her symptoms have
				progressively worsened, affecting her ability to maintain relationships and basic self-care.

				discontinued use after two years due to side effects. She has attended cognitive behavioral
				therapy intermittently, reporting varied success in managing symptoms. There have been no
				hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons. Currently, the patient is not on any psychiatric
				medication but expresses openness to resuming treatment if beneficial.

			<h3 class="subsection-title">FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT:</h3>
			<p>
				The patient's work performance has been notably impacted, with frequent errors and
				absenteeism due to heightened anxiety levels. Socially, she experiences significant distress
				in group settings, avoiding social gatherings and limiting interactions to essential
				communication, which has strained friendships. Self-care routines have deteriorated, with
				irregular eating patterns and sleep disruptions. Despite these challenges, she maintains her
				employment and manages day-to-day responsibilities, highlighting her resilience. She lives
				independently but faces financial stress due to missed workdays and related income loss,
				compounding her anxiety. Her ability to engage in activities she previously enjoyed, like
				reading and exercising, has diminished.

			<h3 class="subsection-title">CLINICAL FORMULATION:</h3>
			<p>
				The patient presents with symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder, with
				significant impact on occupational and social functioning. Her PHQ-9 score suggests moderate
				depression, characterized by pervasive worry and sleep disturbances. The interplay between
				her anxiety and social isolation is evident, exacerbating her symptoms. Her family history
				of anxiety and depression suggests a genetic predisposition, increasing her vulnerability to
				these conditions. Protective factors include her insight into her condition and willingness
				to seek treatment, as well as a supportive relationship with her parents. The patient's
				resilience and motivation to improve her situation are crucial strengths in her recovery
				journey.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="section paragraph" id="risk-assessment">
			<h3 class="subsection-title">RISK ASSESSMENT:</h3>
			<p>
				The patient denies any current or past suicidal or homicidal ideation, which is supported by
				her PHQ-9 response. There are no history of self-harm or suicidal attempts. Substance use is
				not a risk factor, as corroborated by her DAST-10 and AUDIT scores. Her support system
				includes her parents, who are available in crisis situations, providing a crucial safety
				net. The patient has developed a basic safety plan, though it may require further
				elaboration for comprehensive crisis management. Immediate risk is low, but ongoing
				monitoring is recommended to address any potential escalation in symptoms.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="section paragraph" id="prognosis">
			<h3 class="subsection-title">PROGNOSIS:</h3>
			<p>
				The prognosis for the patient is cautiously optimistic, given her insight and willingness to
				engage in treatment. Her motivation to address her anxiety, along with a supportive family,
				are positive indicators. However, the chronicity of her symptoms and financial stressors
				present significant challenges. The patient's previous response to CBT and medication
				suggests potential benefits if reintroduced. Ongoing engagement with her support network and
				addressing financial barriers will be essential for successful treatment outcomes. While
				uncertainties remain, the patient's strengths and determination provide a solid foundation
				for improvement.
