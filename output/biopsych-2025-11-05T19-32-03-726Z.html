Social functioning is also affected, with the patient avoiding social gatherings and experiencing strain in relationships due to irritability and withdrawal. Self-care is somewhat maintained, although the patient reports occasional neglect of household chores and personal hygiene. The patient's creativity remains a strength, providing a positive outlet during periods of distress. Despite these challenges, the patient demonstrates strong independent living skills, managing finances and daily responsibilities with some difficulty.

The PHQ-9 score suggests mild depressive symptoms, likely exacerbated by chronic anxiety. Family history of anxiety and substance use disorders may contribute to the patient's predisposition, while financial stress and job dissatisfaction serve as psychosocial stressors. The patient's resilience and creativity are notable protective factors, alongside a small but supportive social network. The absence of substance use issues further supports a focused treatment approach on anxiety management. Overall, the clinical picture highlights the interplay between anxiety and functional impairment, with potential for significant improvement through targeted interventions.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="risk-assessment"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">RISK ASSESSMENT:</h3><p>The patient denies any current or past suicidal or homicidal ideation. While anxiety levels are high, there are no indications of self-harm or substance relapse risk. The patient's support system, though limited, provides some protective buffer against crisis. Safety awareness is demonstrated through established coping strategies and recognition of when to seek help. Immediate risk is considered low, based on the absence of acute crises, but ongoing monitoring is recommended to ensure stability. The patient has emergency contact availability and is aware of crisis resources, enhancing their capacity to manage potential escalations in anxiety.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="prognosis"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">PROGNOSIS:</h3><p>The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, given the patient's history of responsiveness to therapy and current motivation to address anxiety. The primary challenges include high stress levels at work and financial burdens, which could hinder progress. However, the patient's insight and resilience are encouraging factors for engagement in treatment. The strong desire for improved work-life balance and acknowledgment of personal strengths suggest potential for positive change. Continued support and structured interventions could significantly enhance the patient's quality of life, though ongoing assessment of stressors will be necessary to prevent setbacks.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--table" id="diagnostic-impressions"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:</h3><table class="table" aria-label="DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:"><colgroup><col style="width:10%"><col style="width:12%"><col style="width:78%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col">ICD-10</th><th scope="col">DSM-5 Code</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>F41.1</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>The patient demonstrates persistent worry, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances consistent with generalized anxiety disorder.</td></tr><tr><td>F32.0</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>PHQ-9 indicates mild depressive symptoms, with low mood and concentration issues linked to anxiety.</td></tr></tbody></table></section></section><section class="note-section note-section--top" id="plan"><h2 class="note-section-banner">PLAN</h2><section class="note-section note-section--list" id="interventions-recommended"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">INTERVENTIONS RECOMMENDED:</h3><ol class="list"><li>Medical Management: Referral to primary care physician for medical conditions and psychiatric evaluation for potential pharmacological intervention for presenting symptoms.</li><li>Individual Psychotherapy: Regular individual therapy sessions to address identified issues.
