    "chiefComplaint": "\"I feel overwhelmed with anxiety and can't manage my daily tasks.\"",
    "subjective": {
      "hpi": "The patient reports that their anxiety began approximately six months ago and has progressively worsened. Initially manageable, the anxiety now interferes significantly with daily functioning, including work and social interactions. Coping strategies such as deep breathing and avoiding stressful situations have provided limited relief. The patient experiences daily episodes of racing thoughts and heightened nervousness, often triggered by work-related stress and social gatherings. Sleep disturbances and difficulty concentrating have also been reported, contributing to increased irritability. The patient has not experienced any panic attacks but feels constantly on edge, impacting personal relationships and self-care routines.",
      "pastPsychiatricHistory": "The patient reports a history of mild depression diagnosed three years ago, which was managed with cognitive behavioral therapy for six months with good effect. No psychiatric medications were prescribed at that time. The patient denies any psychiatric hospitalizations or emergency interventions. Currently, the patient is not engaged in any form of therapy or psychiatric treatment and has not taken any psychotropic medications in the past. There has been no history of non-adherence to treatment regimens.",
      "currentMedications": "No current medications",
      "familyPsychiatricHistory": "The patient reports a family history of anxiety disorders, with their mother having been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Additionally, an uncle has a history of alcohol use disorder. The patient is aware of the potential genetic predisposition to anxiety and substance use issues within the family. No other mental health conditions are reported in the immediate family.",
      "medicalHistory": "The patient reports no significant medical conditions or known allergies. Overall health is described as good, with no chronic illnesses. The patient occasionally experiences migraines, which are managed with over-the-counter medications. No interaction between medical and psychiatric symptoms has been noted. The patient maintains regular health check-ups and reports no major health concerns.",
      "socialHistory": "The patient lives alone in an apartment and works as a graphic designer. Although employed full-time, the patient expresses dissatisfaction with their job due to high stress levels. Social interactions are limited, with a small support network consisting of a few close friends and family members. Financial stress is present, primarily due to student loan debt, which adds to the patient's anxiety. The patient identifies creativity and resilience as personal strengths and aims to improve work-life balance.",
      "substanceUseHistory": "The patient denies current or past substance use, including tobacco and illicit drugs. Alcohol consumption is minimal, typically one to two drinks per month. The patient reports no history of legal issues, health problems, or relationship impacts related to substance use. Insight into the importance of maintaining sobriety is acknowledged, with no current motivation to change this pattern. AUDIT and DAST-10 scores indicate no significant substance use concerns."
    },
    "objective": {
      "functionalAssessment": "The patient's functioning is moderately impaired by anxiety, particularly in the workplace where they report decreased productivity and increased absenteeism. Social functioning is also affected, with the patient avoiding social gatherings and experiencing strain in relationships due to irritability and withdrawal. Self-care is somewhat maintained, although the patient reports occasional neglect of household chores and personal hygiene. The patient's creativity remains a strength, providing a positive outlet during periods of distress. Despite these challenges, the patient demonstrates strong independent living skills, managing finances and daily responsibilities with some difficulty. Overall, anxiety has a pervasive impact on multiple areas of life, but the patient shows resilience and willingness to seek help."
    },
    "assessment": {
      "clinicalFormulation": "The patient presents with symptoms indicative of generalized anxiety disorder, as evidenced by persistent worry and difficulty managing daily tasks. The PHQ-9 score suggests mild depressive symptoms, likely exacerbated by chronic anxiety. Family history of anxiety and substance use disorders may contribute to the patient's predisposition, while financial stress and job dissatisfaction serve as psychosocial stressors. The patient's resilience and creativity are notable protective factors, alongside a small but supportive social network. The absence of substance use issues further supports a focused treatment approach on anxiety management. Overall, the clinical picture highlights the interplay between anxiety and functional impairment, with potential for significant improvement through targeted interventions.",
      "riskAssessment": "The patient denies any current or past suicidal or homicidal ideation. While anxiety levels are high, there are no indications of self-harm or substance relapse risk. The patient's support system, though limited, provides some protective buffer against crisis. Safety awareness is demonstrated through established coping strategies and recognition of when to seek help. Immediate risk is considered low, based on the absence of acute crises, but ongoing monitoring is recommended to ensure stability. The patient has emergency contact availability and is aware of crisis resources, enhancing their capacity to manage potential escalations in anxiety.",
      "prognosis": "The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, given the patient's history of responsiveness to therapy and current motivation to address anxiety. The primary challenges include high stress levels at work and financial burdens, which could hinder progress. However, the patient's insight and resilience are encouraging factors for engagement in treatment. The strong desire for improved work-life balance and acknowledgment of personal strengths suggest potential for positive change. Continued support and structured interventions could significantly enhance the patient's quality of life, though ongoing assessment of stressors will be necessary to prevent setbacks.",
