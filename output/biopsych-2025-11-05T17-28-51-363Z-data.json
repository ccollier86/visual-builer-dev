    "chiefComplaint": "\"I'm feeling overwhelmed and anxious about everything in my life.\"",
    "subjective": {
      "hpi": "The patient reports experiencing overwhelming anxiety for the past six months, significantly impacting her daily functioning. She describes persistent worry about her job performance, leading to difficulty concentrating and frequent errors at work. The anxiety is exacerbated by social situations, where she fears judgment and criticism. Sleep disturbances have also been noted, with difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings. Despite these challenges, she has attempted to manage her symptoms through deep breathing exercises and occasional use of over-the-counter sleep aids, with limited success. Her symptoms have progressively worsened, affecting her ability to maintain relationships and basic self-care.",
      "pastPsychiatricHistory": "The patient has a history of generalized anxiety disorder, diagnosed approximately five years ago. She was previously prescribed sertraline, which she found somewhat effective, but discontinued use after two years due to side effects. She has attended cognitive behavioral therapy intermittently, reporting varied success in managing symptoms. There have been no hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons. Currently, the patient is not on any psychiatric medication but expresses openness to resuming treatment if beneficial.",
      "currentMedications": "No current medications.",
      "familyPsychiatricHistory": "The patient's family history is significant for anxiety and depression. Her mother was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and has been on medication for several years. Her paternal uncle has a history of alcohol use disorder. The patient is aware of the potential genetic predisposition to mental health issues and has expressed concern about the impact on her own mental health.",
      "medicalHistory": "The patient reports no significant medical conditions and denies any medication allergies. She describes her overall health as stable, with occasional migraines managed with over-the-counter medications. There is no history of chronic illnesses or significant medical interventions, and she maintains regular check-ups with her primary care physician.",
      "socialHistory": "The patient lives alone in an apartment but maintains regular contact with her parents and a close friend. She is employed full-time as an administrative assistant but reports frequent absenteeism due to her anxiety. Her social network is limited, contributing to feelings of isolation. Financial stress is present, with concerns about meeting rent and other bills, further exacerbating her anxiety. However, she identifies her resilience and determination to improve her situation as strengths.",
      "substanceUseHistory": "The patient denies any current or past use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She reports minimal exposure to substances in her immediate social circle and emphasizes her commitment to maintaining a substance-free lifestyle. The AUDIT and DAST-10 scores corroborate her abstinence, indicating no problematic use or dependency issues. She acknowledges the potential impact of substance use on mental health and actively chooses to avoid it."
    },
    "objective": {
      "functionalAssessment": "The patient's work performance has been notably impacted, with frequent errors and absenteeism due to heightened anxiety levels. Socially, she experiences significant distress in group settings, avoiding social gatherings and limiting interactions to essential communication, which has strained friendships. Self-care routines have deteriorated, with irregular eating patterns and sleep disruptions. Despite these challenges, she maintains her employment and manages day-to-day responsibilities, highlighting her resilience. She lives independently but faces financial stress due to missed workdays and related income loss, compounding her anxiety. Her ability to engage in activities she previously enjoyed, like reading and exercising, has diminished."
    },
    "assessment": {
      "clinicalFormulation": "The patient presents with symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder, with significant impact on occupational and social functioning. Her PHQ-9 score suggests moderate depression, characterized by pervasive worry and sleep disturbances. The interplay between her anxiety and social isolation is evident, exacerbating her symptoms. Her family history of anxiety and depression suggests a genetic predisposition, increasing her vulnerability to these conditions. Protective factors include her insight into her condition and willingness to seek treatment, as well as a supportive relationship with her parents. The patient's resilience and motivation to improve her situation are crucial strengths in her recovery journey.",
      "riskAssessment": "The patient denies any current or past suicidal or homicidal ideation, which is supported by her PHQ-9 response. There are no history of self-harm or suicidal attempts. Substance use is not a risk factor, as corroborated by her DAST-10 and AUDIT scores. Her support system includes her parents, who are available in crisis situations, providing a crucial safety net. The patient has developed a basic safety plan, though it may require further elaboration for comprehensive crisis management. Immediate risk is low, but ongoing monitoring is recommended to address any potential escalation in symptoms.",
      "prognosis": "The prognosis for the patient is cautiously optimistic, given her insight and willingness to engage in treatment. Her motivation to address her anxiety, along with a supportive family, are positive indicators. However, the chronicity of her symptoms and financial stressors present significant challenges. The patient's previous response to CBT and medication suggests potential benefits if reintroduced. Ongoing engagement with her support network and addressing financial barriers will be essential for successful treatment outcomes. While uncertainties remain, the patient's strengths and determination provide a solid foundation for improvement.",
