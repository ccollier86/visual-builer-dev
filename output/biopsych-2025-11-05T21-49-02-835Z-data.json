    "chiefComplaint": "\"I'm feeling overwhelmed and anxious all the time.\"",
    "subjective": {
      "hpi": "The patient reports experiencing persistent anxiety that began approximately six months ago, following a significant change in their work environment. This anxiety has led to difficulty concentrating and frequent irritability, impacting their performance at work. They describe feeling a constant sense of dread and have noted that their sleep has been restless, often waking up feeling exhausted. The patient has attempted to manage these symptoms by practicing meditation and reducing caffeine intake, with minimal improvement. They express concern about the increasing impact on their relationships, particularly with their partner, due to frequent arguments triggered by their irritability. Additionally, the patient mentions that these symptoms have prevented them from enjoying activities they previously found pleasurable.",
      "pastPsychiatricHistory": "The patient has a history of generalized anxiety disorder, first diagnosed three years ago. They report having attended cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions intermittently, finding them somewhat beneficial in managing symptoms. In the past, they were prescribed sertraline, which they took for approximately six months before discontinuing due to side effects. There are no records of psychiatric hospitalizations or other therapeutic interventions. The patient has been reluctant to reinitiate medication but is open to revisiting therapeutic options.",
      "currentMedications": "Currently, the patient is not taking any medications.",
      "familyPsychiatricHistory": "The patient reports a family history of depression, noting that their mother was diagnosed and treated with antidepressants successfully. Additionally, there is an uncle with a history of alcohol use disorder. This family history suggests a potential genetic predisposition to mood disorders, which the patient acknowledges as a concern.",
      "medicalHistory": "The patient reports being generally healthy, with no significant medical conditions. They have a history of seasonal allergies, managed with over-the-counter antihistamines. The patient denies any medication allergies. They maintain an active lifestyle, which they believe helps mitigate some anxiety symptoms, although this has been more challenging recently due to their current mental health state.",
      "socialHistory": "The patient lives with their partner in a rented apartment in the city. They work full-time in a high-pressure marketing job, which they find increasingly stressful. The patient has a few close friends and maintains regular contact with family. Financially, they feel stable, though they express worry about potential work-related instability affecting this. Despite the anxiety, they identify their relationship with their partner and support from friends as significant strengths.",
      "substanceUseHistory": "The patient reports occasional alcohol use, typically consuming a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. They deny any history of tobacco or illicit drug use. There have been no legal issues or significant health consequences related to substance use. The patient is aware of the potential for increased alcohol consumption to exacerbate anxiety and is mindful to keep their intake minimal. They do not currently perceive a need for change in this area."
    },
    "objective": {
      "functionalAssessment": "The patient is experiencing significant functional impairment due to their anxiety. At work, they report missing deadlines and difficulty focusing during meetings, leading to increased stress and concern about job security. In their personal relationships, particularly with their partner, there has been notable strain due to irritability and frequent conflicts. The patient maintains basic self-care routines, though they acknowledge that their motivation to engage in social activities has decreased. Despite these challenges, they have managed to sustain an exercise routine, which they find beneficial for mild mood improvement. The patient reports feeling supported by friends and family, which serves as a protective factor amidst these difficulties."
    },
    "assessment": {
      "clinicalFormulation": "The patient presents with generalized anxiety disorder, characterized by excessive worry, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as evidenced by their GAD-7 score of 17, indicating severe anxiety. This anxiety appears to be exacerbated by stressors at work and interpersonal conflicts, with additional strain on sleep and daily functioning. The family history of depression and alcohol use disorder may contribute to a genetic predisposition, further complicating the clinical picture. Protective factors include a supportive partner and active lifestyle, which provide some resilience against the full impact of their symptoms. The patient's prior partial response to CBT suggests that revisiting therapy could be beneficial. Their insight into the condition and openness to treatment are positive indicators for recovery.",
      "riskAssessment": "The patient currently denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation, as confirmed by their responses during the mental status examination. There is no history of self-harm or previous suicide attempts. While the PHQ-9 item 9 suggests passive thoughts of worthlessness, the patient reports not having any active plans or intent. They have a strong support system, including a partner and close friends, which serves as a protective factor. The patient has a safety plan in place and is aware of crisis resources should their symptoms escalate. Regular monitoring of their anxiety levels and adherence to a structured treatment plan is recommended to reduce potential risk.",
      "prognosis": "The prognosis for the patient is cautiously optimistic, given their insight into the condition and willingness to engage in treatment. The chronicity of anxiety symptoms and family history of mood disorders suggest potential challenges, but the supportive social network and prior positive response to therapy are encouraging. The patient's motivation to improve work performance and personal relationships indicate a strong commitment to change, which may facilitate recovery. Financial stability and access to resources further bolster the likelihood of a favorable outcome, provided that treatment adherence remains consistent.",
