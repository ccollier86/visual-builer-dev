Assessment scores indicate significant anxiety, with GAD-7 reflecting a high level of distress. The interplay of stress from work and familial pressures contributes to the symptom severity. While the patient has a history of treatment, inconsistent adherence and side effects have hindered long-term management. Protective factors include a stable living situation and a supportive sibling, providing a foundation for recovery. The absence of substance use issues simplifies the clinical picture, allowing for targeted anxiety interventions.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="risk-assessment"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">RISK ASSESSMENT:</h3><p>The patient denies current or past suicidal or homicidal ideation. Risk factors include high anxiety levels and recent significant stressors. Protective factors such as a supportive family member and engagement in self-care are present. The patient has not engaged in self-harm behaviors and is aware of contact numbers for crisis services. Immediate risk is low, but ongoing monitoring is advised due to the potential for exacerbation under stress. A safety plan is recommended, emphasizing the importance of maintaining contact with supportive individuals.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--paragraph" id="prognosis"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">PROGNOSIS:</h3><p>The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, given the patient's motivation to address anxiety and the absence of complicating factors such as substance use. The chronicity of anxiety, combined with a history of incomplete treatment adherence, suggests challenges in achieving sustained symptom remission. However, the patient's existing strengths, including problem-solving skills and a supportive sibling, provide a solid foundation for improvement. Financial and housing stability further support engagement in treatment. Continued therapy, alongside potential pharmacotherapy, may enhance outcomes.</p></section><section class="note-section note-section--table" id="diagnostic-impressions"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:</h3><table class="table" aria-label="DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:"><colgroup><col style="width:10%"><col style="width:12%"><col style="width:78%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col">ICD-10</th><th scope="col">DSM-5 Code</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="note-table-primary note-table-italic note-table-muted">F41.1</span></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><span class="note-table-support note-table-muted">GAD-7 score indicates severe anxiety impacting daily functioning.</span></td></tr></tbody></table></section></section><section class="note-section note-section--top" id="plan"><h2 class="note-section-banner">PLAN</h2><section class="note-section note-section--list" id="interventions-recommended"><h3 class="note-subsection-title">INTERVENTIONS RECOMMENDED:</h3><ol class="list"><li>Medical Management: Referral to primary care physician for medical conditions and psychiatric evaluation for potential pharmacological intervention for presenting symptoms.</li><li>Individual Psychotherapy: Regular individual therapy sessions to address identified issues.
