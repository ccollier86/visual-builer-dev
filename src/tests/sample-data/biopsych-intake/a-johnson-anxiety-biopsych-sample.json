    "qaText": "=== CLINICAL INTAKE RESPONSES ===\nGenerated: 11/04/2025, 11:30:00 AM\n\n## CHIEF COMPLAINT\nQ: What brings you in today?\nA: I'm tired of being so anxious all the time. I worry about everything - my health, what people think of me, making mistakes at work. It's exhausting and it's holding me back from living my life.\n\n## CURRENT SYMPTOMS & IMPACT\nQ: How are symptoms impacting your work?\nA: Moderate impact - I'm good at teaching and the kids respond well to me, but I spend way too much time over-preparing lessons because I'm terrified of making mistakes or parents complaining. Parent-teacher conferences make me incredibly anxious. I worry for days before administrator observations.\n\nQ: How are symptoms impacting your relationships?\nA: Severe impact - I avoid most social situations, haven't dated in 2 years because first dates terrify me, have very few close friends because I'm too anxious to put myself out there\n\nQ: How are symptoms impacting your self-care?\nA: Moderate impact - anxiety disrupts my sleep, sometimes I'm too anxious to eat, I check my body constantly for signs of illness which creates more anxiety\n\nQ: Current stress level (1-10)?\nA: Usually 7/10, spikes to 9/10 in social situations or when I notice a new health symptom\n\nQ: Sleep quality?\nA: Poor - takes me 1-2 hours to fall asleep because I'm worrying, wake up early with anxiety\n\nQ: Days missed from work in past month?\nA: 0 - I never miss work, even when very anxious\n\nQ: Describe your worry patterns\nA: I worry about everything. Health is a big one - if I notice any symptom (headache, weird sensation, anything), I immediately think it's something serious like cancer or a brain tumor. I Google symptoms constantly which makes it worse. I also worry excessively about what people think of me. After any social interaction I replay it over and over analyzing what I said and convinced I embarrassed myself. I check my body multiple times a day for lumps or changes. I check that my apartment door is locked 3-4 times before leaving.\n\nQ: How do you respond to physical sensations?\nA: Any unusual physical sensation triggers immediate anxiety. Heart palpitation? Must be a heart problem. Headache? Brain tumor. Stomach pain? Must be cancer. I know logically this isn't rational but I can't stop the thoughts. I've been to my PCP multiple times in the past year for symptoms that turned out to be nothing, but I still can't shake the worry.\n\n## DAILY LIFE & SELF-CARE\nQ: Describe your typical day\nA: Wake up around 6am, usually already feeling anxious. Check my phone for any messages I'm worried about. Get ready for work while mentally rehearsing my lesson plans. Teach all day - this is actually when I feel best because I'm focused on the kids. After school I grade papers and over-plan lessons. Come home, make dinner, then spend evening worrying about various things - did I say something wrong today, is this headache serious, what if I get fired, etc. Try to sleep but mind races. Takes 1-2 hours to fall asleep.\n\nQ: How do you cope with anxiety?\nA: Not very well. I avoid situations that make me anxious which provides short-term relief but makes it worse long-term. I seek reassurance from my mom constantly ('Do I look sick? Does this feel like cancer to you?'). I Google symptoms which always makes it worse. I check things repeatedly. None of these actually help but I can't seem to stop.\n\n## GOALS & STRENGTHS\nQ: What are your top treatment goals?\nA: 1) Reduce constant worry so I can enjoy my life more. 2) Be comfortable in social situations so I can make friends and try dating. 3) Stop health anxiety and excessive checking. 4) Sleep better. 5) Stop avoiding things due to anxiety.\n\nQ: What personal strengths can you build on?\nA: I'm a good teacher and care about my students. I have a supportive family. I'm educated and intelligent. I'm motivated to change. I don't use substances to cope. I'm aware the anxiety is excessive and irrational.\n\nQ: Motivation for change (1-10)?\nA: 8/10 - I'm tired of living like this and missing out on things\n\nQ: What barriers do you anticipate?\nA: Avoidance has become a habit. Social situations genuinely terrify me. The health worries feel so real even though I know they're probably not. I'm scared medication might have side effects that could be dangerous (my health anxiety talking).\n\n## DIAGNOSES\nDiagnosis 1:\nQ: Diagnosis code\nA: F41.1\n\nQ: Diagnosis description\nA: Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\nDiagnosis 2:\nQ: Diagnosis code\nA: F40.10\n\nQ: Diagnosis description\nA: Social Anxiety Disorder\n\nDiagnosis 3:\nQ: Diagnosis code\nA: F45.21\n\nQ: Diagnosis description\nA: Illness Anxiety Disorder\n\n## TREATMENT HISTORY\nNo previous mental health treatment - this is first time seeking help\n\n## MEDICATIONS (CLINICIAN-VERIFIED)\nQ: Current medications\nA: Birth control (oral contraceptive)\n\nQ: Previously trialed psychiatric medications\nA: None - this is patient's first time seeking mental health treatment.\n\n## MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION\nQ: Appearance\nA: Neat, appropriate dress, good hygiene, appears stated age, somewhat tense posture\n\nQ: Behavior\nA: Cooperative, good eye contact though averts gaze when anxious about topic, fidgets with hands, checks phone multiple times during session\n\nQ: Speech\nA: Normal rate, somewhat soft spoken, articulate\n\nQ: Stated mood\nA: \"Anxious, worried, tired of feeling this way\"\n\nQ: Observed affect\nA: Anxious, mood-congruent, range somewhat restricted, becomes visibly more anxious when discussing social situations or health concerns\n\nQ: Thought process\nA: Linear, organized, some rumination noted, tendency toward catastrophic thinking\n\nQ: Thought content\nA: Denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

Primary impairments are in social/relationship domain and quality of life. Good prognosis with CBT and possible medication.\n\nQ: Clinical Recommendations\nA: Recommend: 1) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) weekly with focus on exposure therapy for social anxiety, cognitive restructuring for catastrophic thinking, and response prevention for checking behaviors. 2) Consider SSRI trial - educate about medication given health anxiety concerns, start low and go slow. 3) Mindfulness-based strategies for physical symptom tolerance. 4) Psychoeducation about anxiety cycle and how avoidance maintains fear. 5) Gradual exposure hierarchy for social situations. 6) Limit reassurance-seeking and body checking. 7) Consider group therapy for social anxiety once individual therapy establishes foundation. Follow-up in 2 weeks.",
