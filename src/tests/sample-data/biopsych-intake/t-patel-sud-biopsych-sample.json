    "qaText": "=== CLINICAL INTAKE RESPONSES ===\nGenerated: 11/04/2025, 3:30:00 PM\n\n## CHIEF COMPLAINT\nQ: What brings you in today?\nA: My husband gave me an ultimatum - get help for my drinking or he's taking the kids and leaving. I don't want to lose my family. I also can't afford to lose my nursing license. I know I have a problem.\n\n## CURRENT SYMPTOMS & IMPACT\nQ: How are symptoms impacting your work?\nA: Severe impact - called in sick 6 times in 2 months, mostly hangovers. Sometimes I'm still slightly impaired when I show up for my shift. I work in ICU so I could hurt someone. I'm terrified of that.\n\nQ: How are symptoms impacting your relationships?\nA: Severe impact - my marriage is falling apart, I'm irritable with my kids especially when I'm hungover, I've isolated from all my friends out of shame\n\nQ: How are symptoms impacting your self-care?\nA: Severe impact - drinking interferes with sleep, not eating properly, gained 20 pounds, sometimes don't shower before work, spending money on alcohol I hide from my husband\n\nQ: Current stress level (1-10)?\nA: 9/10 - I'm afraid of losing everything\n\nQ: Sleep quality?\nA: Terrible - I pass out from drinking but wake up at 3am sweating and anxious, then can't fall back asleep\n\nQ: Days missed from work in past month?\nA: 3 days\n\nQ: Tell me about your drinking pattern\nA: It started as 1-2 glasses of wine to help with pain and stress after my car accident. Over the past 2 years it's escalated to 3-4 glasses every night, more on weekends. I'm hiding bottles in my closet. I drink after my kids go to bed. Sometimes I wake up and don't fully remember putting them to bed. I've tried to stop on my own several times - I can make it maybe 3 days then the anxiety and cravings are overwhelming. I'm afraid I'm physically dependent now because I get shaky and sweaty when I try to stop.\n\nQ: Have you experienced withdrawal symptoms?\nA: Yes - when I try to stop I get shaky hands, sweating, anxiety that feels unbearable, irritability, nausea. That's part of why I keep drinking.\n\nQ: Tell me about your history with prescription pain medication\nA: After my car accident I was prescribed Percocet. It helped with pain and also made me feel calm and happy for the first time in years. Within 6 months I was taking more than prescribed. I'd run out early and experience withdrawal. I was doctor shopping, lying to my prescriber. Finally my PCP confronted me and helped me taper off last year. It was hell. After I stopped the opioids, I started drinking more to cope with the pain and the cravings. Looking back, I just traded one substance for another.\n\nQ: Current cravings for opioids?\nA: Yes, daily. Especially when my back pain flares up. I think about them all the time. But I'm too afraid to use them again because I know where that road leads. The alcohol felt 'safer' but now I'm dependent on that too.\n\n## DAILY LIFE & SELF-CARE\nQ: Describe your typical day\nA: Wake up around 6am feeling terrible (hangover). Get kids ready for school while trying to hide how bad I feel. Go to work, struggle through 12-hour shift. Come home exhausted. Make dinner for family. Put kids to bed. As soon as they're asleep, I pour wine. Tell myself it's just one glass to relax. End up drinking the whole bottle. Pass out around 11pm. Wake up at 3am with anxiety and guilt. Can't fall back asleep. Repeat.\n\nQ: How do you cope with pain now that you're not on opioids?\nA: Poorly. I take gabapentin and ibuprofen but they don't really help. The alcohol numbs it temporarily. I know I need to find better pain management solutions but everything hurts and I'm so tired.\n\nQ: How do you cope with stress and emotions?\nA: I drink. That's my only coping mechanism now. I used to exercise, spend time with friends, have hobbies. Now it's just work, kids, drink, sleep.\n\n## GOALS & STRENGTHS\nQ: What are your top treatment goals?\nA: 1) Stop drinking before I lose my family or hurt a patient at work. 2) Learn to manage my chronic pain without substances. 3) Address the anxiety and depression I've been self-medicating. 4) Save my marriage and be a good mother again. 5) Keep my nursing license.\n\nQ: What personal strengths can you build on?\nA: I'm intelligent and educated - I know intellectually what I need to do. I have a lot to lose which motivates me. My husband is willing to support me if I commit to treatment. My brother went through recovery and can help. I have good insurance and can afford treatment.\n\nQ: Motivation for change (1-10)?\nA: 10/10 - I'm terrified of losing my family and my career. I don't want to die from this.\n\nQ: What barriers do you anticipate?\nA: Chronic pain is a big one - I need better pain management solutions. Work stress - 12-hour ICU shifts are brutal. Fear of withdrawal symptoms. Shame about admitting I have a problem. Worried about stigma if people at work find out.\n\n## DIAGNOSES\nDiagnosis 1:\nQ: Diagnosis code\nA: F10.20\n\nQ: Diagnosis description\nA: Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe\n\nDiagnosis 2:\nQ: Diagnosis code\nA: F11.20\n\nQ: Diagnosis description\nA: Opioid Use Disorder, in sustained remission (history of)\n\nDiagnosis 3:\nQ: Diagnosis code\nA: F41.1\n\nQ: Diagnosis description\nA: Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\nDiagnosis 4:\nQ: Diagnosis code\nA: F33.1\n\nQ: Diagnosis description\nA: Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate\n\n## TREATMENT HISTORY\nTreatment 1:\nQ: Type of treatment\nA: Mental Health - Tried Zoloft for 1 year, discontinued because drinking increased while on it.

History of opioid use disorder (Percocet) for which she completed supervised taper last year, now substituting alcohol to manage pain, anxiety, and opioid cravings. Assessment scores confirm severe alcohol use disorder (AUDIT: 31), low-moderate drug use (DAST-10: 4, reflecting past opioid use and ongoing cravings), moderate-to-severe depression (PHQ-9: 16), and severe anxiety (GAD-7: 17). Reports withdrawal symptoms when attempting to stop drinking (tremor, sweating, anxiety, nausea) suggesting physiological dependence and need for medically supervised detox consideration. Family history strongly positive for substance use (father alcoholic, brother in recovery) and mental health issues. Childhood exposure to father's alcoholism is risk factor. Significant stressors include high-stress occupation (ICU nurse), strained marriage, parenting responsibilities, chronic pain, and fear of professional consequences. Patient demonstrates excellent insight and motivation (10/10), multiple protective factors (education, family, employment, insurance), but faces significant barriers (chronic pain, high-stress job, physical dependence on alcohol). High risk for continued use without intensive intervention but good prognosis with appropriate treatment given insight and motivation.\n\nQ: Clinical Recommendations\nA: Recommend comprehensive integrated treatment: 1) Medical evaluation for potential need for medically supervised detox given withdrawal symptoms - coordinate with PCP Dr. Torres, may need short-term medical detox or medication-assisted management of withdrawal (benzodiazepine taper, thiamine supplementation). 2) Medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder - consider naltrexone or acamprosate once medically cleared, discuss risks/benefits. 3) Psychiatric medication evaluation - likely benefit from SSRI or SNRI for comorbid anxiety/depression, but must be careful given history of Ativan dependence (avoid benzodiazepines long-term). 4) Intensive outpatient program (IOP) for substance use - 3x week minimum given severity, include group therapy, relapse prevention, recovery skills. 5) Individual therapy weekly - trauma-informed approach addressing car accident trauma, shame, pain management, relapse prevention. 6) Pain management consultation - multimodal pain management without opioids or alcohol, may need physiatry or pain specialist referral. 7) Marriage/family therapy once patient stabilizes - husband's support is critical protective factor. 8) Peer support strongly encouraged - AA, SMART Recovery, or specialty groups for healthcare professionals (RN recovery groups exist). 9) Close monitoring for suicide risk given passive ideation history - safety planning. 10) Coordination with employer/nursing board may be necessary if drinking affects work - many states have confidential monitoring programs for nurses in recovery that allow license retention. 11) Case management for coordination of complex treatment needs. 12) Address ACE score impact (score of 4) - childhood exposure to father's alcoholism has contributed to current presentation. Very close follow-up needed - weekly initially, reassess after 2-4 weeks. High priority case given risk to patient safety, family, and potential risk to patients in her care.",
