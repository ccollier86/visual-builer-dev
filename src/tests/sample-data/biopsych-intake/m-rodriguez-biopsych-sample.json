Trazodone 50mg for sleep for 3 months - discontinued due to morning grogginess that interfered with work functioning.\n\n## MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION\nQ: Appearance and presentation\nA: Casually dressed in work clothes (Amazon uniform), appears slightly older than stated age, poor grooming (unshaven, disheveled hair), appears fatigued\n\nQ: Behavior and activity level\nA: Cooperative but guarded initially, fidgeting with hands, poor eye contact, becomes tearful when discussing daughters\n\nQ: Speech pattern and quality\nA: Normal rate and volume, but monotone affect in voice, occasional long pauses before answering emotionally difficult questions\n\nQ: Stated mood\nA: \"Depressed, angry, exhausted\"\n\nQ: Observed affect\nA: Constricted and dysphoric, briefly tearful when discussing children, flattened overall with occasional flashes of irritability\n\nQ: Thought process/organization\nA: Linear and goal-directed, no flight of ideas, coherent but occasionally tangential when discussing trauma history\n\nQ: Thought content\nA: Denies current suicidal ideation but endorses passive thoughts 6 months ago (\"thought everyone would be better off without me\"), no current plan or intent. Denies homicidal ideation but acknowledges anger control issues (\"I punch walls, never people\"). Significant guilt about divorce and impact on daughters. Rumination about past mistakes.\n\nQ: Perceptual disturbances (hallucinations/illusions)\nA: Denies hallucinations. Reports occasional intrusive memories/flashbacks of childhood domestic violence and work injury. Hypervigilance noted (\"always waiting for something bad to happen\").\n\nQ: Cognitive functioning and orientation\nA: Alert and oriented x4 (person, place, time, situation). Attention somewhat impaired by depressive symptoms and sleep deprivation. Memory appears intact for recent and remote events. Concentration impaired - reports difficulty at work with multi-step tasks.\n\nQ: Level of insight\nA: Fair to good - recognizes he needs help, acknowledges drinking is problematic, understands connection between childhood trauma and current struggles, motivated to change for daughters\n\nQ: Quality of judgment\nA: Currently fair - seeking treatment is positive, but recent judgment impaired by substance use (DUI 14 months ago, continued heavy drinking despite consequences). Understands risks but struggles to implement changes.\n\nQ: Clinical Impressions\nA: Patient presents with severe depression complicated by untreated PTSD from childhood trauma and recent life stressors, alongside severe alcohol use disorder that patient is using as maladaptive coping mechanism. The interplay between these conditions is significant - childhood domestic violence exposure has created trauma response patterns that are triggered by his own divorce and family disruption. His alcohol use, while initially providing temporary relief from depression and PTSD symptoms, is now exacerbating his mental health decline and creating additional stressors (DUI, work performance issues, financial strain). Assessment scores confirm severe depression (PHQ-9: 21), moderate-to-severe PTSD symptoms (PCL-5: 52), and severe alcohol use disorder (AUDIT: 28). High ACE score (6/10) indicates significant childhood adversity contributing to current presentation. Patient's insight and motivation are protective factors, as is his deep love for his daughters and relationship with supportive sister. Immediate risks include job loss, another DUI, worsening physical health from alcohol use, and potential suicide risk if depression continues to worsen. Patient requires integrated treatment addressing mental health and substance use simultaneously.\n\nQ: Clinical Recommendations\nA: Recommend comprehensive integrated treatment approach including: 1) Psychiatric evaluation for medication management - consider SSRI trial (patient discontinued Zoloft prematurely, may benefit from adequate trial at therapeutic dose with proper monitoring) and possible adjunct medication for sleep given severe insomnia, 2) Individual trauma-focused therapy (EMDR or CPT) to address childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms, 3) Substance use treatment - recommend intensive outpatient program (IOP) given severity of alcohol use disorder and need for structured support, include relapse prevention planning, 4) Case management for care coordination and resource connection, 5) Possible short-term medical leave from work to focus on stabilization if symptoms continue to impair functioning, 6) Safety planning given past suicidal ideation - establish crisis resources and check-ins, 7) Encourage engagement with peer support (AA or SMART Recovery) for substance use recovery, 8) Family therapy or parenting support to improve relationship with daughters and address guilt. Priority is stabilizing substance use and depression to prevent further deterioration and potential safety crisis.\n\n=== END OF CLINICAL INTAKE ===",
